# Description
This processes the raw dataset into the version used in the data visualization app (found in [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/tethersurvey))

This is a reference and won't actually run - it relies on Prolific IDs, which have been redacted for anonymity.

The purpose of this is to document the derived columns in the data viz application.
